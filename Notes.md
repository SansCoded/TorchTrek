**Introduction to PyTorch -**
PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It’s widely used for developing and training machine learning models, particularly in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning.
PyTorch has become one of the most popular tools in the machine learning community because of its dynamic computational graph (also called eager execution), ease of use, and strong support from the research community.
